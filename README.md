# Ormond Voting System
An automatic vote counting system created in collaboration with Luke Jacobson @jukelacobson1. 

# How to use/demo/install instructions
See the bottom of this README


# Why?
We created this to speed up the calculation of the Ormond College election results. The results are calculated using the single transferable vote system, similar to how the Australian Senate is elected.

# Benefits
This system is used to great effect to speed up our election process. Our General Council elections used to take around ten hours to tally up all the votes by hand, we estimate that with our system the process should take a fifth of the time (two hours for the GC elections).

Hopefully, this will be of great help to the college returning officer in October for running the general elections. This system could also be of use to anyone looking to run any elections using the single transferable vote system.

# Further Improvements
The current system uses excel as the data entry method. While we have streamlined this process as much as we could think of there is room for improvement.
  1. Creating collaboration tools. The current workflow for having mutiple people count votes requires them to keep individual sheets and then combine them into a master sheet.
  2. Run the system as a web application. Storing data in the cloud so that it could be accessed on multiple devices.
  3. Adding a optical character reader, so that ballots could be scanned. In the current workflow the biggest time sink is data entry.

# Demo



# Installation Proccess

1. git clone this repository.
2. Install any version of python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Install openpyxl, which allows the reading and writing of Excel files `pythonX.X -m pip install --user -U openpyxl==2.6.2`, where X.X should be the version number of python you have installed
4. The program is installed and ready to run (see below)
